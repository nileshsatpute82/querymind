## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Couchbase not initialized"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **"Environment"** tab
4. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
5. Check for typos in connection string, username, password
6. Click **"Manual Deploy"** ‚Üí **"Clear build cache & deploy"**

### Issue: "Please configure your OpenAI API key first"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you've logged into the admin dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Make sure your OpenAI account has credits

### Issue: Interview link shows "Interview not found"

**Solution:**
1. Check that the interview status is "active" in the dashboard
2. Verify Couchbase connection is working
3. Check Render logs for errors

### Issue: Questions not generating

**Solution:**
1. Check OpenAI API key is configured correctly
2. Verify your OpenAI account has credits
3. Check Render logs for API errors

### Issue: Render service keeps spinning down (Free tier)

**Note:** This is expected behavior on the free tier. The service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request after spin-down takes 30-60 seconds.

   - No login required for interviewees

4. **Monitor and analyze**
   - Watch responses in real-time
   - Review AI-generated summaries
   - Extract insights from structured data

5. **Scale as needed**
